Copy git-followfile into PATH and make it executable.

# What does it do
I love trying to follow how open source projects evolve. This gives
you a git subcommand `git followfile /path/to/file` that lets you
check out the earliest commit a file has, and then prompts you to
move to the next commit that impacts the file when you are ready.
